       "The whitepaper does not explicitly discuss limitations or risks of using the RiskCalc v3.1 model in a stagflationary environment. However, based on the information provided, we can infer some potential limitations and risks:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Reliance on market data**: A key component of the RiskCalc v3.1 model is the incorporation of forward-looking market data through the distance-to-default measure derived from public firm equity prices. In a stagflationary environment, where economic growth stagnates while inflation remains high, equity markets may not accurately reflect the risks faced by companies, especially private firms. This could lead to inaccurate default risk assessments.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Lagging financial statement data**: The model relies heavily on financial statement data from private firms, which is typically reported annually or quarterly with a significant lag. In a rapidly changing stagflationary environment, the lagging financial data may not capture the current risks faced by firms, leading to inaccurate risk assessments.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Industry-specific effects**: The whitepaper highlights the importance of controlling for industry variation in the model. However, in a stagflationary environment, certain industries may be impacted differently, and the model's industry adjustments may not accurately capture these varying effects.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Historical data limitations**: The model is calibrated and validated using historical data, which may not fully represent the unique challenges and risks posed by a stagflationary environment. If the historical data does not include periods of prolonged stagflation, the model's performance in such an environment may be suboptimal.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Stress testing limitations**: While the whitepaper discusses the ability to stress test the model under different credit cycle scenarios, it is unclear if the stress testing framework can adequately capture the specific dynamics of a stagflationary environment, which combines elements of both economic stagnation and high inflation.\n",
       "\n",
       "To mitigate these potential risks, the authors of the whitepaper emphasize the importance of rigorous model validation, including out-of-sample and out-of-time testing. However, they do not explicitly address the model's performance in a stagflationary environment. Users of the RiskCalc v3.1 model should be aware of these potential limitations and risks and consider supplementing the model's output with additional analysis and expert judgment when assessing credit risk in a stagflationary environment."

       "The whitepaper does not explicitly discuss limitations or risks of using the RiskCalc v3.1 model in a hyper-inflation scenario. However, we can infer some potential risks and limitations based on the model methodology:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Financial ratios may become distorted**: In a hyper-inflationary environment, financial ratios based on historical costs and nominal values may get distorted and lose their predictive power for assessing credit risk. The model relies heavily on financial ratios, so this could impact its accuracy.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Lags in financial reporting**: The whitepaper notes that private firm financial statements can significantly lag behind the current economic conditions, exacerbated by reporting delays. In a hyper-inflation scenario, this lag could be even more pronounced, reducing the model's ability to capture rapidly changing conditions.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Market signals may diverge**: The model uses distance-to-default measures from public firms in the same sector to capture forward-looking market signals. However, in extreme inflationary environments, market signals may diverge from actual credit risk due to distortions and dislocations.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Structural changes**: Hyper-inflation can cause structural changes in the economy and business environment that the model, trained on historical data, may not be able to fully capture or adjust for.\n",
       "\n",
       "While not explicitly stated, the whitepaper emphasizes the need for the model to be re-estimated and recalibrated periodically to account for changes in the credit environment. A hyper-inflationary scenario would likely necessitate such a re-estimation and potential methodology adjustments to maintain the model's predictive accuracy.\n",
       "\n",
       "In summary, while not directly discussed, the RiskCalc v3.1 model's reliance on financial ratios, market signals, and historical data could pose limitations in accurately assessing credit risk during periods of hyper-inflation unless the model is updated and recalibrated accordingly."

       "   - The RiskCalc v3.1 model is designed to always produce the same estimate of default risk for a given set of inputs, meeting the Basel II requirement for \"meaningful differentiation of risk, and accurate and consistent quantitative estimates of risk.\"\n",
       "   - The model's performance is robust and stable, providing excellent differentiation between defaulters and accurate estimates of default probability.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Forward-looking Risk Ratings:\n",
       "   - The RiskCalc v3.1 model incorporates the collective perspective of the market sector in which a firm operates, in addition to fundamental financial statement inputs.\n",
       "   - This is consistent with the Basel II requirement that risk-rating models use all available information, including the impact of future economic conditions, in determining a borrower's rating.\n",
       "   - The model includes monthly updates with the market's aggregated outlook on the general economy and the firm's particular industry.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. Stress Testing Default Probabilities:\n",
       "   - The RiskCalc v3.1 model is designed to stress test a firm's sensitivity to the probability of default at different stages of a credit cycle.\n",
       "   - This feature satisfies the Basel II requirement for banks to have \"sound stress testing processes for use in the assessment of capital adequacy.\"\n",
       "   - The model allows users to compare a firm's current probability of default under current market conditions with both worst-case and best-case probabilities of default over the past credit cycle.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. Model Validation:\n",
       "   - Moody's KMV has pioneered the use of empirical validation in commercial credit models and validates the RiskCalc v3.1 model using a rigorous testing process.\n",
       "   - The model's power (ability to rank-order firms from more to less risky) and calibration (how well its predictions match actual outcomes) are extensively tested.\n",
       "   - The validation process includes out-of-sample testing, walk-forward analysis, and testing on data that became available after the model was completed, meeting the Basel II requirement for \"a rigorous statistical process for validating the selection of explanatory variables.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "In summary, the RiskCalc v3.1 model was designed to meet the key requirements of the New Basel Capital Accord, including consistent risk estimates, forward-looking risk ratings, stress testing capabilities, and a robust validation framework. This ensures the model provides reliable and accurate credit risk assessments for private firms."

       "   - The FSO mode is based on financial statement information, similar to the previous RiskCalc v1.0 model.\n",
       "   - It includes financial statement variables that capture a firm's long-run performance.\n",
       "   - Predictions of default risk are updated only as often as the firm updates its financial statements, typically once a year or quarterly.\n",
       "   - The FSO mode is best suited for users who desire a stable estimate of a firm's default risk for certain applications.\n",
       "   - The FSO mode incorporates industry information in addition to the financial statement data.\n",
       "   - The FSO mode uses a robust model form that balances the need to incorporate non-linear relationships while maintaining transparency for the user.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Complete Version:\n",
       "   - The complete version of the RiskCalc v3.1 model combines forward-looking equity market information (the distance-to-default measure) with firm-specific financial statement data.\n",
       "   - The distance-to-default measure captures systematic, market-based information about the firm's industry that is not fully reflected in the financial statements alone.\n",
       "   - The complete version provides significantly more accurate EDF (Expected Default Frequency) levels, more frequent updates incorporating all relevant data, and the ability to stress test EDF measures under different credit cycle scenarios.\n",
       "   - The complete version is recommended for users who want the most predictive measures of credit risk for private, middle-market companies.\n",
       "\n",
       "Strengths and Use Cases:\n",
       "\n",
       "Financial Statement Only (FSO) Mode:\n",
       "- Strength: Provides a stable, transparent estimate of default risk based solely on financial statement information.\n",
       "- Use case: Suitable for applications where a consistent, easy-to-interpret default risk measure is required, such as portfolio monitoring or regulatory reporting.\n",
       "\n",
       "Complete Version:\n",
       "- Strength: Delivers more accurate and responsive default risk estimates by incorporating both firm-specific and market-based information.\n",
       "- Use case: Recommended for applications that require the most predictive credit risk measures, such as loan origination, pricing, portfolio analysis, and high-frequency monitoring.\n",
       "\n",

       "1. Introducing industry variation:\n",
       "   - The RiskCalc v3.1 model introduced the ability to control for industry variation, which is an important factor in tracking default risk.\n",
       "   - Incorporating the distance-to-default factor allowed industry-wide trends in the public markets to be quickly reflected in estimates of private firm default risk.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Impact on model power:\n",
       "   - Controlling for industry effects yielded a modest increase in model predictive power, as demonstrated by a higher Accuracy Ratio.\n",
       "   - This indicates that the model was able to more accurately order firms from more risky to less risky by accounting for industry-specific differences.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. Impact on model calibration:\n",
       "   - Controlling for industry effects also delivered better accuracy in the probability of default level, as demonstrated by a substantial increase in the log likelihood measure.\n",
       "   - This suggests that the model's EDF values were better aligned with observed default rates when industry variation was incorporated.\n",
       "\n",
       "The whitepaper provides evidence of the importance of capturing industry effects in the Financial Statement Only (FSO) mode of RiskCalc v3.1. Specifically:\n",
       "- The Accuracy Ratio increased from 54.4% to 55.1% at the one-year horizon, and from 38.1% to 38.8% at the five-year horizon, when industry controls were introduced.\n",
       "- The relative increase in log likelihood was 58.16% at the one-year horizon and 99.8% at the five-year horizon, both statistically significant at the 0.01% level.\n",
       "\n",
       "These results demonstrate that both the power and calibration of default risk prediction improved by differentiating the model by industry. This allowed the model to better capture differences in average default rates across industries and control for spurious effects between industry and other model variables.\n",
       "\n",
       "In summary, the introduction of industry variation was a key innovation in the RiskCalc v3.1 model, as it significantly enhanced the model's ability to accurately rank-order firms by risk and provide well-calibrated default probability estimates, particularly when compared to the previous RiskCalc v1.0 model."

       "1. Expanded Data Pool for Predictions\n",
       "   - The Credit Research Database used to develop RiskCalc v3.1 has significantly more data than the previous version:\n",
       "     - 95% more financial statements\n",
       "     - 132% more defaults\n",
       "     - Data from 2000-2002 added, covering a full credit cycle\n",
       "   - The expanded and higher quality data led to improved model performance, with the re-estimated RiskCalc v1.0 model outperforming the original by 3.5 and 5.3 points in 1-year and 5-year accuracy ratios.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Managing Data Quality\n",
       "   - Misclassification Errors:\n",
       "     - Moody's KMV applied techniques from Hausman et al. (1998) to detect and correct misclassification of defaults vs. non-defaults.\n",
       "     - This helped address data integrity issues from incomplete historical records and acquisition integrations.\n",
       "   - Benford's Law:\n",
       "     - Moody's KMV used Benford's Law to identify potential accounting anomalies and excessive rounding in the financial statement data.\n",
       "     - While some observations with high rounding probability were flagged, the final model performed better when these were included, likely due to common rounding practices in the middle market.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. Alternative Estimation Techniques\n",
       "   - Random Effects:\n",
       "     - Moody's KMV tested models with different forms of time dependence in the error term to address potential period-to-period dependence.\n",
       "     - They found the coefficients and rank ordering were stable across different time dependence specifications.\n",
       "   - Duration Modeling:\n",
       "     - Experiments with duration models like Cox proportional hazards showed similar performance to the discrete choice probit/logit models used.\n",
       "     - The discrete choice formulation was preferred as it allows more flexibility in weighting factors at different horizons.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. Extending the Default Term Structure\n",
       "   - Moody's KMV found evidence of mean reversion in credit quality in their data, with good credits tending to deteriorate and bad credits improving over time.\n",
       "   - To capture this, they implemented a parametric distribution that can produce monotonically increasing or decreasing hazard rates.\n",
       "   - This allows the RiskCalc v3.1 model to provide cumulative default probabilities for any duration from 9 months to 5 years, versus just the 1-year and 5-year horizons previously.\n",
       "   - Accounting for mean reversion is important for accurate loan pricing, as it prevents under-pricing of high quality credits and over-pricing of low quality credits.\n",
       "\n",
       "In summary, the key modeling improvements in RiskCalc v3.1 were:\n",
       "1. Expanding the high-quality data in the Credit Research Database\n",
       "2. Pioneering techniques to manage data quality issues like misclassification and accounting anomalies\n",
       "3. Rigorously testing alternative modeling approaches like random effects and duration models\n",
       "4. Enhancing the term structure of default probabilities to capture mean reversion in credit quality\n",

       "2. Specific findings:\n",
       "   - Model Power:\n",
       "     - RiskCalc v3.1 outperforms RiskCalc v1.0 and other alternative models in terms of predictive power, as measured by the Accuracy Ratio (AR). (Tables 5 and 6)\n",
       "     - The power improvements are largely in the middle of the distribution, indicating better discrimination of credits in the middle range. (Figure 5)\n",
       "   - Model Calibration:\n",
       "     - RiskCalc v3.1 provides substantially better calibration of default probabilities compared to RiskCalc v1.0 and other models, as measured by the increase in log likelihood. (Tables 5 and 6)\n",
       "   - Out-of-Sample Testing:\n",
       "     - RiskCalc v3.1 maintains its performance in out-of-sample and out-of-time testing, with the difference in AR between in-sample and out-of-sample results being no more than 1 point. (Figures 6 and 7)\n",
       "     - In a pure out-of-sample test on a holdout dataset, RiskCalc v3.1 outperforms RiskCalc v1.0 by 6.0-8.0 points in AR. (Table 6)\n",
       "   - Performance Over the Credit Cycle:\n",
       "     - RiskCalc v3.1 maintains its predictive power throughout the credit cycle, outperforming RiskCalc v1.0, Z-score, and the Private Firm Model across different default rate environments. (Table 8)\n",
       "\n",
       "3. Recommendations:\n",
       "   - The extensive validation results demonstrate that the RiskCalc v3.1 model is a highly robust and accurate default prediction model for private firms. The model's superior performance in terms of power, calibration, and out-of-sample testing, as well as its ability to maintain performance over the credit cycle, support the adoption of this model for usage.\n",
       "   - The model's enhancements, such as the incorporation of industry-level and market-based information, have significantly improved its predictive capabilities compared to the previous version and other alternatives. This suggests that the RiskCalc v3.1 model would provide substantial economic benefits to users in terms of improved credit risk assessment and portfolio performance.\n",

In a competitive environment, for a medium-sized bank, pricing loans with the RiskCalc v3.1 model would translate into profits of more than $10 million higher on average compared to a competitor that uses a model such as Z-Score. Part of this savings comes from the fact that the bank would also experience a lower default rate.\n",

       "1. Consistent Risk Estimates:\n",
       "   - The RiskCalc v3.1 model will always produce the same estimate of default risk for a given set of inputs, meeting the Basel II requirement for \"meaningful differentiation of risk, and accurate and consistent quantitative estimates of risk.\"\n",
       "   - The model's performance is robust and stable, providing excellent differentiation between defaulters and accurate estimates of default probability.\n",

       "2. Forward-looking Risk Ratings:\n",
       "   - The RiskCalc v3.1 model incorporates the collective perspective of the market sector in which a firm operates, in addition to fundamental financial statement inputs.\n",
       "   - This is consistent with the Basel II requirement that risk-rating models use all available information, including the impact of future economic conditions, to assess a borrower's ability and willingness to perform.\n",

       "3. Stress Testing Default Probabilities:\n",
       "   - The RiskCalc v3.1 model is designed to stress test a firm's sensitivity to the probability of default at different stages of a credit cycle, satisfying the Basel II imperative for \"sound stress testing processes\" to assess a bank's ability to withstand changes in economic conditions.\n",
       "   - The model allows users to compare a firm's current probability of default under current market conditions with both worst-case and best-case probabilities of default over the past credit cycle, given the firm's current financial state.\n",

       "\n",
       "1. The increased power of the RiskCalc v3.1 model to differentiate risk can yield significant increases in profits:\n",
       "   - A bank using RiskCalc v3.1 might increase the profitability of its loan portfolio by as much as 25 basis points.\n",
       "   - In a competitive environment, for a medium-sized bank, pricing loans with this model would translate into profits of more than $10 million higher on average compared to a competitor that uses a model such as Z-Score. Part of that savings comes from the fact that the bank would also experience a lower default rate.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. The white paper cites recent research by Stein (2003) and Stein and Jordão (2003) that provides a framework for estimating the explicit dollar value based on the additional predictive power of a default model:\n",
       "   - Powerful models are generally more profitable than weaker ones, regardless of the lending approach.\n",
       "   - A bank switching to a more powerful model (while keeping the same stream of borrowers) would enjoy meaningful benefits in terms of additional profit, even in the absence of competition.\n",
       "   - In a competitive environment, a bank using a more powerful model has an advantage over a bank using a weaker model because the latter would tend to suffer from adverse selection (gaming) towards customers that were correctly risk-priced by the bank with the powerful model.\n",
       "   - Banks using even simplified risk-pricing approaches to lending enjoyed even greater benefits when competing against banks with less powerful models.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. The white paper provides a quantitative analysis to demonstrate the magnitude of the impact of using the new RiskCalc v3.1 model:\n",
       "   - Compared to alternative models, the FSO mode of RiskCalc v3.1 could yield an estimated 0.7 to 25 basis points of additional profit per dollar of credit granted.\n",
       "   - For a typical mid-sized bank, this translates to $297,500 to $10,625,000 in additional profits when using RiskCalc v3.1 versus alternative models, depending on the lending approach (switching, competing using cutoffs, or competing using pricing).\n",
       "\n",
       "In summary, the white paper provides strong evidence that the enhanced predictive power of the RiskCalc v3.1 model can deliver substantial economic value and profitability benefits to users, especially in competitive lending environments."

       "1. **Model Power and Calibration**:\n",
       "   - The RiskCalc v3.1 model demonstrates superior predictive power compared to previous versions and other alternative models.\n",
       "   - The model has strong power to discriminate between defaulting and non-defaulting borrowers, as evidenced by higher Accuracy Ratios.\n",
       "   - The model also shows better calibration, with its default probability predictions more closely matching actual default rates, as indicated by higher log-likelihood measures.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Validation via Out-of-Sample Data**:\n",
       "   - Moody's KMV used rigorous out-of-sample and out-of-time testing frameworks, including K-fold analysis and walk-forward testing, to validate the model's performance.\n",

       "   - RiskCalc v3.1 outperforms the previous RiskCalc v1.0 model in both out-of-sample and out-of-time testing.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Testing Details**:\n",
       "   - The whitepaper provides detailed results of various out-of-sample and out-of-time testing approaches, including K-fold analysis, walk-forward testing, and a holdout sample test.\n",
       "   - These tests demonstrate the model's robustness and ability to generalize to new data, with the holdout sample test providing the strongest evidence of the model's out-of-sample performance.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Model Performance Over the Credit Cycle**:\n",

       "\n",
       "Based on the comprehensive validation and testing results presented in the whitepaper, the RiskCalc v3.1 model appears to be a robust and generalizable model for predicting private firm credit risk. The model demonstrates superior performance in both in-sample and out-of-sample/out-of-time testing, indicating that it can reliably and accurately assess credit risk for private firms across different economic conditions and time periods.\n",

       "Based on the information provided in the whitepaper, the RiskCalc v3.1 model has the following capabilities regarding the term structure of default probabilities:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Continuous Term Structure**: The new version of the RiskCalc model incorporates mean reversion through the use of a parametric distribution, which allows users to obtain a cumulative default probability for any duration between 9 months and 5 years. This provides a continuous term structure, as opposed to just the 1-year and 5-year cumulative default probabilities produced by the original RiskCalc model.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Flexibility for Loan, Investment, and Pricing Applications**: The ability to calculate default probabilities for any duration between 9 months and 5 years enables the analysis of nearly any loan term, investment horizon, or pricing application. This flexibility is valuable, as a bank making a 3-year loan would be more interested in the 3-year EDF credit measure rather than just the 1-year or 5-year measures.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Accounting for Mean Reversion**: The whitepaper notes that the new term structure framework accounts for mean reversion in credit quality, where good credits tend to become somewhat worse over time and bad credits tend to improve over time. Capturing this mean reversion is important for accurate pricing of loans, as assuming a constant 1-year default probability over the life of a loan could lead to mispricing.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Responsiveness to Credit Cycle**: The term structure can be stress tested to understand a firm's sensitivity to default probability at different stages of the credit cycle, which is a key requirement under the Basel II Accord. This allows users to separate the impact of systematic risk from idiosyncratic firm-specific risk.\n",
       "\n",
       "In summary, the RiskCalc v3.1 model's enhanced term structure capabilities, including the continuous probability calculations, mean reversion modeling, and credit cycle stress testing, provide a more comprehensive and flexible tool for assessing default risk across a variety of loan, investment, and pricing applications. This represents a significant improvement over the original RiskCalc model."

       "\n",
       "2. **Extending and Filling In the Default Term Structure (Section 3.4.3)**\n",
       "   - The RiskCalc v3.1 model incorporates mean reversion in credit quality through the use of a parametric distribution.\n",
       "   - This allows the model to capture the observed phenomenon that good credits tend to become somewhat worse over time, while bad credits (conditional upon survival) tend to become better over time.\n",
       "   - Accounting for mean reversion is important when pricing loans, as it helps avoid under-pricing higher quality credits (whose default probabilities tend to deteriorate over time) and over-pricing low quality credits (whose default probabilities tend to improve over time) during periods of high inflation and volatility.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Model Validation (Section 4)**\n",
       "   - The whitepaper presents extensive validation of the RiskCalc v3.1 model, including out-of-sample and out-of-time testing.\n",
       "   - The model's performance is shown to be robust and stable, providing excellent differentiation between defaulters and accurate estimates of default probability.\n",
       "   - Specifically, the model's power and calibration are tested over time, demonstrating that it maintained its predictive power during one of the most active periods of default activity since 1920 (the 2000-2002 period).\n",

       "   - The RiskCalc models are estimated individually for each country to reflect the credit and accounting practices of the domicile (Section 1, Overview).\n",
       "   - This allows the model to adapt to changes in accounting practices and reporting standards, which can be important during periods of high inflation.\n",

       "   - The model has been extensively validated, including out-of-sample and out-of-time testing, to ensure its performance remains robust during different economic conditions (Section 4).\n",
       "\n",
       "4. Continuous term structure of default probabilities:\n",

       "\n",
       "2. Specific findings:\n",
       "   - The RiskCalc v3.1 model introduces the ability to control for industry variation, which is an important factor in tracking default risk (Section 3.4.2).\n",
       "   - Controlling for industry effects yields a modest increase in model predictive power by more accurately ordering firms from more risky to less risky, as demonstrated by a higher Accuracy Ratio (Section 3.4.2).\n",
       "   - The RiskCalc v3.1 model outperforms other models, such as RiskCalc v1.0, the Private Firm Model, and Z-score, across different industries and time periods, as shown in the validation results (Section 4).\n",
       "   - The model's performance is robust out-of-sample and out-of-time, indicating that it can accurately differentiate between defaulting and non-defaulting firms even in volatile economic conditions, such as periods of hyperinflation (Section 4).\n",

       "   - The RiskCalc v3.1 model appears well-equipped to handle the challenges of differentiating between defaulting and non-defaulting firms across different industries during periods of hyperinflation. The model's ability to control for industry variation and its robust out-of-sample and out-of-time performance suggest that it can provide accurate and reliable credit risk assessments even in volatile economic environments.\n",
       "   - To further validate the model's performance during hyperinflationary conditions, it would be beneficial to conduct additional testing using data from historical periods of high inflation in specific industries. This could help confirm the model's ability to accurately differentiate between defaulting and non-defaulting firms across a range of industries under such challenging economic conditions.\n",
       "   - Overall, the RiskCalc v3.1 model appears to be a strong choice for assessing credit risk in private, middle-market companies, even in the face of industry-specific challenges posed by hyperinflation."

       "   - The RiskCalc v3.1 model incorporates the distance-to-default measure, which is a market-based indicator that reflects the market's perception of a firm's credit risk.\n",
       "   - The distance-to-default measure is a leading indicator of default risk, as it can capture changes in a firm's credit profile that may not yet be reflected in its financial statements.\n",
       "   - By including the distance-to-default factor, the RiskCalc v3.1 model is able to quickly incorporate the impact of economic changes that have not yet been reflected in private firm financial statements.\n",
       "   - This is particularly important in the context of hyperinflationary pressures, where market-based indicators may be more responsive and forward-looking compared to lagging financial statement data.\n",
       "   - The whitepaper provides an example (Figure 3) showing how the full RiskCalc v3.1 model, which includes the distance-to-default factor, was able to provide a leading indicator of increasing default risk for a private firm, whereas the financial statement-only mode did not capture this change in risk profile.\n",
       "   - The model's ability to stress test a firm's probability of default under different credit cycle scenarios (as described in Section 2.3) further enhances its forward-looking capabilities, allowing users to assess a firm's sensitivity to changing economic conditions.\n",

       "   - By incorporating the distance-to-default factor, industry-wide trends in the public markets are quickly reflected in estimates of private firm default risk.\n",

       "\n",
       "2. Adjusting for Differences in Default Rates Across Sectors\n",
       "   - The RiskCalc v3.1 model is able to adjust for intrinsic differences in default probability across industries.\n",

       "\n",
       "3. Stress Testing Across the Credit Cycle\n",
       "   - The RiskCalc v3.1 model is designed to stress test a firm's sensitivity to the probability of default at different stages of the credit cycle.\n",
       "   - This allows the model to capture how a firm's default risk may change not just due to its own financials, but also due to broader industry and macroeconomic conditions.\n",
       "   - During periods of hyperinflation, the model can compute a firm's best-case and worst-case default scenarios based on the general credit cycle conditions, even if the firm's own financial statements have not yet reflected the impact.\n",
