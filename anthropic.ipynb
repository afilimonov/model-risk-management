       "Assess model whitepaper for compliance with documentation of model maintenance activities\n",
       "\n",
       "# Instructions\n",
       "Review the model whitepaper to ensure it includes the following documentation related to model maintenance:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Materials and evidence that the model is being properly maintained, including model-specific procedures, performance tracking results, output analysis, and testing and changes in response to validation findings or other identified model discrepancies.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Confirmation that copies of the model documentation are stored in a safe place, preferably off-site, to facilitate disaster recovery.\n",
       "\n",
       "# Report\n",
       "\n",
       "The RiskCalc v3.1 model whitepaper provides some documentation related to model maintenance activities, but does not fully cover all aspects specified in the instructions.\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Materials and evidence of model maintenance:\n",
       "   - The whitepaper describes the process of model validation, including out-of-sample testing, walk-forward testing, and testing on new data (Sections 4.2 and 4.3). It presents the results of these validation tests, demonstrating the model's performance and power.\n",
       "   - However, the whitepaper does not provide specific details on model-specific procedures for ongoing monitoring, performance tracking, output analysis, and changes made in response to validation findings or other issues.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Confirmation of secure storage of model documentation:\n",
       "   - The whitepaper does not explicitly confirm that copies of the model documentation are stored in a safe place or off-site location for disaster recovery purposes.\n",
       "\n",
       "# Conclusion\n",
       "\n",
       "The RiskCalc v3.1 model whitepaper partially complies with the AB guidance requirements for documenting model maintenance activities. While it provides evidence of model validation and performance testing, it lacks details on specific procedures for ongoing monitoring, output analysis, and changes made in response to issues identified. Additionally, the whitepaper does not confirm the secure storage of model documentation for disaster recovery purposes.\n",
       "\n",
       "# Recommendations\n",
       "\n",
       "To fully comply with the AB guidance requirements, the following additions to the model documentation are recommended:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Include a section detailing the model-specific procedures for ongoing monitoring, performance tracking, output analysis, and the process for making changes to the model in response to validation findings or other identified discrepancies.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. Explicitly confirm that copies of the complete model documentation, including technical details, code, data dictionaries, and validation results, are stored in a secure, off-site location to facilitate disaster recovery in case of an emergency.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. Consider adding a summary of any changes or updates made to the model since its initial development, along with the reasons for those changes (e.g., addressing specific issues identified during validation or monitoring).\n",
       "\n",
       "By incorporating these recommendations, the RiskCalc v3.1 model whitepaper would provide more comprehensive documentation of model maintenance activities, aligning with the AB guidance requirements."
