## Analysis Highlights Limitations in Stagflation Environment

* The model incorporates market information through distance-to-default measures to make it more forward-looking and responsive to changing economic conditions ([Sections 1.1, 3.2](https://github.com/jim-schwoebel/voice-samples/blob/main/model-risk-validator.md#112-strategic-innovations-from-combining-our-two-powerful-approaches)). However, the precise impact of stagflation conditions is not explicitly modeled. 
* The model is designed to capture both systematic and idiosyncratic risk factors ([Section 1.1](https://github.com/jim-schwoebel/voice-samples/blob/main/model-risk-validator.md#112-strategic-innovations-from-combining-our-two-powerful-approaches)). However, the relative importance of these factors during periods of stagflation is unclear.
* The model has been tested based on historical data over full business cycles, including the high default periods of 2000-2002 ([Section 2.2](https://github.com/jim-schwoebel/voice-samples/blob/main/model-risk-validator.md#22-expanded-data-pool-for-predictions)). However, the specific conditions of stagflation were not present historically over the model development period.
* The model validation focuses on the ability to rank-order firms by credit risk rather than perfectly predict default rates in all conditions ([Section 4.1](https://github.com/jim-schwoebel/voice-samples/blob/main/model-risk-validator.md#41-model-power-and-calibration)). The precise calibration of probabilities during stagflation periods has not been explicitly validated.

## Recommendation

* Additional validation should be conducted by stress testing model performance in stagflation conditions before adopting for usage. 
* Any new validation data in such conditions that becomes available should be utilized to re-calibrate model if needed.
* For now, utilize model for rank-ordering and credit monitoring purposes but use caution in interpreting absolute probability levels in unvalidated stagflation scenarios.

In summary, while the RiskCalc v3.1 model has demonstrated robust performance across a variety of economic conditions historically, some uncertainty exists around its calibration in hypothetical stagflation environments. Additional validation efforts are warranted before full adoption for usage and reliance. The model does retain utility for monitoring and rank-ordering purposes in the interim.
