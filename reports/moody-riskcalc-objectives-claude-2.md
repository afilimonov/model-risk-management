## Generate a list of objecttives for assessing the model peformance in different economic environments usingf providedl model whitepaper
Based on the information provided in the whitepaper, here are the key objectives for assessing the model performance in different economic environments:

1. Assess the model's ability to rank-order firms from more risky to less risky (model power) across different economic conditions and credit cycles.
2. Evaluate the model's accuracy in predicting actual default rates (model calibration) during periods of economic volatility and changing credit conditions.
3. Determine the model's stability and consistency in performance across different industries, firm size classifications, regions, and time periods to ensure it is not overfitted.
4. Test the model's ability to capture and respond to systematic, market-based risk factors as well as firm-specific, idiosyncratic risk factors that drive credit problems.
5. Validate the model's compliance with regulatory requirements, such as the New Basel Capital Accord, for delivering consistent risk estimates, forward-looking risk ratings, and robust stress testing capabilities.
6. Quantify the economic value and profitability benefits that the model's enhanced predictive power can deliver to users, especially in competitive lending environments.
7. Assess the model's performance in both in-sample and out-of-sample/out-of-time testing to ensure its robustness and generalizability.
8. Evaluate the model's ability to provide a continuous term structure of default probabilities that can be used for various loan, investment, and pricing applications.
