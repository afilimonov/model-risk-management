## Consider model usage risks in hyper-inflation scenario
 Here is a detailed model analysis focusing on model usage risks in a hyper-inflation scenario:

Bullet points:

- The model is calibrated using historical data from 1970-2002. This period does not include any significant hyper-inflation events in the U.S. or Canada. Using the model to make predictions during a period of hyper-inflation would likely lead to inaccurate risk estimates (Section 1.1). 

- The model incorporates both firm-specific financial statement data as well as market-based data on industry distance-to-default. During hyper-inflation, accounting-based financial ratios may become distorted and less comparable over time. Market data could also behave erratically (Section 3.2).

- The ability to stress test the model under different economic scenarios or credit cycles is highlighted as a key capability (Sections 2.3, 3.2). However, there are no specific stress tests showing model performance under hyper-inflation conditions.

- There is no discussion of modifying or adapting the model methodology itself to account for hyper-inflation dynamics. The model may not be robust under this scenario.

Recommendation:

The RiskCalc v3.1 model is not designed to operate accurately under conditions of hyper-inflation. Using the model to make risk estimates or lending decisions during such a period would likely lead to poor performance. Additional research and development would be needed to adapt the model to account for hyper-inflation dynamics before it could be reliably used. 

Until such enhancements have been made and validated, I would not recommend adopting RiskCalc v3.1 for usage in markets experiencing very high or hyper-inflation levels. The lack of hyper-inflation in the historical calibration data, the potential distortion of financial ratios, and the lack of specific stress testing under this scenario are all limitations that pose too high of model risk. Further R&D would be required before usage approval could be justified.
