## Generate a list of the model analysis objectives using provided model whitepaper
Based on the whitepaper, the key model analysis objectives are:

1. Assess the strategic assets of the RiskCalc v3.1 model, including its data, validation, localization, regulatory support, term structure, update frequency, stress testing, and integration capabilities.
2. Evaluate the strategic innovations in the RiskCalc v3.1 model by comparing it to the previous Moody's RiskCalc v1.0 and KMV Private Firm Model.
3. Analyze the expanded data pool used for the RiskCalc v3.1 model development and its impact on model performance.
4. Examine how the RiskCalc v3.1 model was designed to meet the requirements of the New Basel Capital Accord, including consistent risk estimates, forward-looking risk ratings, stress testing, and model validation.
5. Assess the two modes of the RiskCalc v3.1 model - the Financial Statement Only (FSO) mode and the complete version - and their respective strengths and use cases.
6. Evaluate the introduction of industry variation into the RiskCalc v3.1 model and its impact on model power and calibration.
7. Analyze the various modeling improvements made in the RiskCalc v3.1 model, including data quality management, alternative estimation techniques, and the extended default term structure.
8. Assess the validation of the RiskCalc v3.1 model, including its power, calibration, out-of-sample testing, and performance over the credit cycle.
9. Estimate the economic value and profitability benefits for users of the RiskCalc v3.1 model compared to alternative models.
