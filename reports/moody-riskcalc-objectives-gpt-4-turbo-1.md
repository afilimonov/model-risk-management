## Generate a list of the model analysis objectives using provided model whitepaper
Based on the provided whitepaper for Moody’s KMV RiskCalc™ v3.1 Model, the analysis objectives can be outlined as follows:

- **Evaluate Predictive Power and Accuracy**: 
  - Assess the model's ability to differentiate between defaulting and non-defaulting firms accurately. This involves examining the model's power and calibration, particularly through out-of-sample and out-of-time testing methodologies described in Section 4, "Model Validation".

- **Assess Economic Value and Profitability Impact**:
  - Determine the economic value and potential profitability impact of adopting the RiskCalc v3.1 model over other models, as discussed in Section 5, "Economic Value of RiskCalc v3.1 Model Power Differential". This includes evaluating the model's performance in a competitive lending environment and its ability to improve loan portfolio profitability.

- **Review Data Quality and Model Stability**:
  - Analyze the quality of the data used in developing the model and the stability of the model across different datasets and time periods. This includes examining the techniques used for managing data quality and the results of K-fold and walk-forward analyses presented in Section 4.3, "Testing Details".

- **Examine Model Innovations and Enhancements**:
  - Investigate the specific innovations and enhancements introduced in RiskCalc v3.1, including the incorporation of industry-specific information, the use of the distance-to-default measure, and the introduction of a continuous term structure for default probabilities. Refer to Sections 2 and 3 for details on these model features.

- **Assess Regulatory Compliance and Support**:
  - Evaluate how well the RiskCalc v3.1 model meets regulatory requirements, particularly those outlined in the New Basel Capital Accord. This involves reviewing the model's support for consistent risk estimates, forward-looking risk ratings, stress testing default probabilities, and validation processes as described in Section 2.3, "Support for Regulatory Requirements".

- **Analyze Model Performance Across Credit Cycles**:
  - Analyze the model's performance across different credit cycles to understand its robustness and reliability under varying economic conditions. This includes reviewing the model's performance over nearly a decade, as presented in Section 4.4, "Model Performance Over the Credit Cycle".

- **Review Model's Integration and Application in Credit Analysis Tools**:
  - Consider how the RiskCalc v3.1 model integrates with and enhances Moody’s KMV credit analytic tools, including Credit Monitor®, Portfolio ManagerTM, and Moody’s KMV Financial Analyst. This involves understanding the model's role in improving underwriting decisions, portfolio monitoring, and risk assessment processes.

These objectives aim to provide a comprehensive analysis of the RiskCalc v3.1 model, focusing on its predictive accuracy, economic benefits, data quality, regulatory compliance, and overall performance in predicting private firm credit risk.
